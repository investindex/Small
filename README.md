# Concerns for the small investor

I’d like to reiterate that especially for small investors, building an ideal portfolio is not as important as investing without major delay. If simplifying will prevent you from waiting, then simplify. You can even maintain geographic diversification with global funds like [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) and [BNDW](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/bndw).

A small investor’s gains in wealth will at first emerge overwhelmingly from earning and saving until they can invest more money. This may make the process initially seem to require more effort than the gains are worth. But recall that capital appreciation [implies exponential growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gn4F1VmTvM), where the highest absolute gains emerge in the latest years after decades of growth. If you wait a year to start, you’re postponing the foundation upon which those largest gains will be built.

Let’s say you invest $1,000 in stocks your first year and make only $100. Was that worth all the research and decision-making you did to get started? Consider that if you keep the $100 invested in stocks, that alone will be worth thousands of dollars in 40 years. And the same is true for every additional $100 you save and put into your stock funds. From the perspective of your future self, of course it was worth the effort, because you can see the enormous value of a small amount of money given time to appreciate.

Finally, the objective of investing as early in life as possible is not only the concrete profit. Too many people are uncomfortable with and even fearful of financial decisions, so becoming informed about financial planning early will allow you to progress through the new learning and decisions required throughout your life with greater confidence and ease.

_ETF details_: Someone investing a small amount of money does not need to build a complex portfolio with six or eight ETFs, and may find it hard to do so if the price of a single share is a significant fraction of their total investment. Options are [provided](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md) for selecting a portfolio with three ETFs or even one, but you could design other simple portfolios with two to four ETFs.

_Mutual fund details_: Many Vanguard mutual funds have a $3,000 minimum. If you are investing less than $30,000 in the complex mutual fund portfolio, the 10% portion falls below the minimum. The same is true for someone investing less than $10,000 in the simple mutual fund portfolio. This can be solved by switching to ETFs, by concentrating your allocation, or by using products from Fidelity or Schwab with no minimum investment.

Including at least one mutual fund in your portfolio permits you to invest every dollar. For someone with a $100K portfolio, $50 remaining after investing in an ETF portfolio is not important. But for someone starting with $500, the effortless fractional shares offered by mutual funds are an easy way to prevent cash drag. However, I still don't suggest using mutual funds in taxable accounts, because minimizing taxes is important for your returns.

# Concerns for the large investor

In his 2016 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett wrote:

“Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.

I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.

That professional, however, faces a problem. Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients, year after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&P 500? That would be career suicide. Large fees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. That advice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment “styles” or current economic trends make the shift appropriate.

The wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling, entertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it. Their money, they feel, should buy them something superior compared to what the masses receive.

In many aspects of life, indeed, wealth does command top-grade products or services. For that reason, the financial “elites” — wealthy individuals, pension funds, college endowments and the like — have great trouble meekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a few thousand dollars.”

&nbsp;

Wealthy individuals naturally find it easier to pay for expert personalized advice, which is [undoubtedly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI5p8vqdjTw) [valuable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeTsh--UEe4) to many people. But they have special access to very few investment opportunities that most people would want, if they understood the risks and likely returns. Be skeptical of exclusive offers.

As Buffett emphasized, there are many advisors who are incentivized to sell you high-fee products which generate profits for them at the expense of their clients. So you cannot seek professional advice without understanding that some advisors are predatory or [uninformed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlpwTJJEasA). Of course, people with almost any level of income and wealth can use professional financial advice. If you seek a financial advisor, I recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i8D0fPzATg&t=2253s), which reviews a list of questions you can use to assess a potential advisor.
