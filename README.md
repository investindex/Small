# Concerns for the small investor

I’d like to reiterate that especially for small investors, building an ideal portfolio is not as important as investing without major delay. If simplifying will prevent you from waiting, then simplify. You can even maintain geographic diversification with a total global fund like [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT).

A small investor’s gains in wealth will at first emerge overwhelmingly from earning and saving until they can invest more money. This may make the process initially seem to require more effort than the gains are worth. But recall that capital appreciation [implies exponential growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gn4F1VmTvM&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel), where the highest absolute gains emerge in the latest years after decades of growth. If you wait a year to start, you’re postponing the foundation upon which those largest gains will be built.

Let’s say you invest $1,000 in stocks your first year and make only $100. Was that worth all the research and decision-making you did to get started? Consider that if you keep the $100 invested in stocks, that alone will be worth thousands of dollars in 40 years. And the same is true for every additional $100 you save and put into your stock funds. From the perspective of your future self, of course it was worth the effort, because you can see the enormous value of a small amount of money given time to appreciate.

Finally, the objective of investing as early in life as possible is not only the concrete profit. Too many people are uncomfortable with and even fearful of financial decisions, so becoming informed about financial planning early will allow you to progress through the new learning and decisions required throughout your life with greater confidence and ease.

_ETF details_: Someone investing a small amount of money does not need to build a complex portfolio with seven ETFs, and may find it hard to do so if the price of a single share is a significant fraction of their total investment. Options are [provided](https://github.com/investindex/Funds) for selecting a portfolio with three ETFs or even one, but you could design other simple portfolios with two to four ETFs.

_Mutual fund details_: Many Vanguard mutual funds have a $3,000 minimum. If you are investing less than $30,000 in the complex mutual fund portfolio, the 10% portion falls below the minimum. The same is true for someone investing less than $10,000 in the simple mutual fund portfolio. This can be solved by switching to ETFs, by concentrating your allocation, or by using products from Fidelity or Schwab with no minimum investment. Fidelity mutual funds have no minimum investment for those using a Fidelity brokerage account, and the same is true of Schwab mutual funds in a Schwab account.
